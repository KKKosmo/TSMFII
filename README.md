TSMFII (Tokai Seat Motor Final Inspection Instructions) is a mobile application made with Unity. This was the final project for my internship at Creotec. The objective was to make a digital inspection sheet, and a detailed interactive manual at the same time for a company. The employees would use it for inspecting products, or if they have any need for guidance about their work.

only some scripts are open source as I do not own the product.
