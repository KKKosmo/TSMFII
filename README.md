TSMFII (Tokai Seat Motor Final Inspection Instructions) - Mobile application made with Unity. A project for my internship at Creotec. The objective was to make a detailed interactive production manual/all-in-one-tool that a specific company can use. 
Used Unity because boss told us to, but I would have chosen something better for a small app and also relatively easy to learn for my co-workers who were new to mobile development, like react native or flutter.


Only some scripts are open source as I do not own the product.

Memory management can be improved, it sometimes crashes on old phones.
