(Tokai Seat Motor Final Inspection Instructions) is a project for my internship at Creotec.

Mobile application made with Unity/C#.

The company who requested the app has integrated it into their procedures and has made their production faster.

The objective was to make a detailed interactive production manual/all-in-one-tool that a certain company can use.

Used Unity because boss told us to, but I would have chosen something better for a small app and also relatively easy to learn for my co-workers who were new to mobile development, like react native or flutter.





Only some scripts are open source as I do not own the product.

Memory management can be improved, it sometimes crashes on old phones.
